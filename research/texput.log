*\begin{proof}

*  If the exact equation has a unique solution for each $n$, then the zeros

*  obtained from its solutions on the \tmverbatim{critical line} can be counted


*  since they are enumerated by the integer $n$, leading to the counting

*  function $N_0 (t)$ in Equation (\ref{N0}). The number of solutions obtained

LaTeX Warning: Reference `N0' on page 1 undefined on input line 0.


*  on the \tmverbatim{critical line} would saturate the counting function of

*  the number of solutions on the \tmverbatim{critical strip} so that $N (t) =

*  N_0 (t)$ and thus all of the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta$ would be

*  enumerated in this manner. If there are zeros off of the critical line, or

*  zeros with multiplicity $m \geqslant 2$, then the exact Equation (\ref{ee})

LaTeX Warning: Reference `ee' on page 1 undefined on input line 0.


*  would fail to capture all the zeros on the critical strip which would mean

*  $N_0 (t) < N (t)$. \ {\cite[IX]{z0t}}
