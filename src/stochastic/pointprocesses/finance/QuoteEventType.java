/**
 * In [La07], J. Large try to work with ten types of orders: <br>
 * <br>
 * 1. Market buy that moves the ask value <br>
 * 2. Market sale that moves the bid value <br>
 * 3. arriving bid moves best bid up <br>
 * 4. arriving ask moves best ask down <br>
 * 5. Market buy that doesn't move the ask value <br>
 * 6. Market sale that doesn't move the bid value <br>
 * 7. Bid at or below bid value <br>
 * 8. Ask at or above ask value <br>
 * 9. Cancelled bids <br>
 * 10. Cancelled asks <br>
 * 11. Midprice moves (the union of the bid and ask value moves)<br>
 * 
 * TODO: enhance this code to use {@link EnumSet}s, since they do really
 * efficient bit-shifting indices and boolean operations quickly, and this is
 * really what all of measure-theory boils down to, is sigma-algebras
